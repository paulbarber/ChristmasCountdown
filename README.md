# ChristmasCountdown

A python program and scripts to show a days, hours, min and seconds until Christmas Day.
Intended for use on a Raspberry Pi without the desktop running. Runs full screen for use with a projector.

TODO:
Only really works from Dec 1 to Dec 25, maybe show countdown to New Year as well.
Shows plurals always, e.g. "1 days"
